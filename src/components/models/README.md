# Models for 3DStories

This folder contains the 3D models used in the **3DStories** application. Each model is responsible for rendering a full story scene.

## ðŸ†• Adding a New Model

1. **Place the Model File**  
   Add your `.glb` or `.gltf` file to the `/public/models/` directory at the root of this repository.

2. **Generate JSX/TSX Component**  
   Use the [gltfjsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gltfjsx) CLI tool to wrap the model into a component:

   ```bash
   npx gltfjsx public/models/character.glb
   ```

   This will create a `.jsx` or `.tsx` component based on your file.

3. **Update the Model URL**  
   Adjust the `useGLTF` path to match the public folder structure:

   ```diff
   - const { scene, animations } = useGLTF('character.glb')
   + const { scene, animations } = useGLTF('/models/character.glb')
   ```

   And also update the preload line:

   ```diff
   - useGLTF.preload('character.glb')
   + useGLTF.preload('/models/character.glb')
   ```

## ðŸ“– Using the Model in a Story

To use a model in a specific story:

1. **Import the Model**  
    Import the model component into the corresponding story-specific `.tsx` component located in `src/components/scenes/`. E.g; for a character model `src/models/Character.jsx` generated by `gltfjsx`, you would import it like this:

   ```tsx
   import { editable as e } from '@theatre/r3f'
   import { Model } from '../models/Character'
   ```

   Then use it in your scene component function. inside a `<Canvas>` R3D component, e.g. wrapped in a theatre group:

   ```jsx
   <e.group theatreKey='Model'>
     <Model position={[0, 0.4, 0]} rotation={0} scale={4} />
   </e.group>
   ```

2. **Link Story to Scene**  
   Every story file under `/content/stories` must have a matching scene component in the `src/components/scenes/` folder.

3. **More Info**  
   Refer to [`src/components/scenes/README.md`](../src/components/scenes/README.md) for details on how to create and structure a scene component.
